to some interesting places in Malaysia. Usually I will go on holiday with my family and 
also follow the tours organized at the school. Lots of experiences and memories I got after going on a trip. 
Those experiences gave me a lot of knowledge apart from fun. 
The exploration in the tour also provided an experience that I will never forget. 
So, I will share with you all about my travel experience. I also list some of the places I have visited for you all.

  <h3><li><font face="goudy old style"><font color="#006400"><b>Cameron Highland &#127827</b></h3>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">Going to Cameron Highlands is like being abroad with such cold weather. 
Of course many people have vacationed there including me who have visited there 3 times. 
The first time I went was in 2012 which was when I was still in form 1. The second time was in 2017 
and the third time was in 2020.</p></li></h5>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">The experience I went through there was unforgettable 
because so many things happened. Among them is the cold weather that makes me shiver and feel like 
I don't want to take a shower. HAHAHAHA. Also, there was an incident where the car I was riding in broke down. 
So, we had to wait for it to recover and continue the journey while waiting.</p></li></h5>

  <h3><li><font face="goudy old style"><font color="#BA55D3"><b>Genting Highland &#127906</b></h3>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">Genting Highland which is very popular 
among tourists from within and outside the country is also a place that gives me an experience. 
The first time I went there was in 2011 with my primary school friends. 
I felt very excited to go there and was happy when both my parents gave me permission. 
Upon arriving in Genting Highland, I could not wait to go tour around it. 
Lots of interesting games I play with friends.</p></li></h5>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">The experience I still remember was when 
riding a roller coster. My feelings at that time were mixed where I felt happy and nervous at the same time. 
As the roller coaster moved, I screamed out loud in fear. That was the first time I rode a roller coaster 
that moved so fast that it scared me to ride it again.</p></li></h5>

  <h3><li><font face="goudy old style"><font color="#4169E1"><b>Kelantan &#9969</b></h3>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">Kelantan is one of the states 
that gave me an experience that I will never forget. 
My first and last time there was in 2016. As everyone knows, Kelantan is famous 
for many interesting places and things that are the focus of tourists. 
I have visited some interesting places such as “Pantai Cahaya Bulan”, Pasar Siti Khadijah, 
and places that produce batik. All of those places gave me a valuable experience as 
I was able to see a new atmosphere outside of my place.</p></li></h5>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">The experience that I definitely remember is 
when going to a place that produces batik. For the first time, I was able to try to “mencanting batik” by myself. 
Although the results were not very good but I was happy to have such an experience. This is because, the process of 
"mencanting batik" is not as easy as expected and requires precise and good techniques to get the best quality.
It was a new lesson and the best experience for me.</p></li></h5>

  <h3><li><font face="goudy old style"><font color="#A52A2A"><b>Melaka &#127979</b></h3>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">Just mention the state of Melaka, for sure many have visited there. 
The historical city has many places that can be visited in terms of history, entertainment, and so on. 
As we all know, the once colonized state is always visited by tourists who want to see historical objects as well as learn new things.</p></li></h5>
<h5><p><font face="lucida sans"><font color="black">The experience I gained while in Melaka was very valuable 
because I was able to learn about the past. I could see the historic buildings that were built long ago and it amazed me. 
I explored areas inhabited by colonizers in the past. Knowing every story there makes me interested to know more. 
The point is that Melaka is a place that provides valuable experiences for us to take as lessons.</p></li></h4>
